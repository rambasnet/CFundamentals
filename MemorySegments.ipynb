    "        - dynamically allocated variables (using pointers) are allocated from this segment\n",
    "        - Heap size is normally much larger compared to stack size\n",
    "        - size (acutal) grows and shrinks based on program needs\n",
    "    3. BSS segment (Block Started by Symbol, also called the uninitialized data segment)\n",
